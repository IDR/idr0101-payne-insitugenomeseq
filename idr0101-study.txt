																				Comment[IDR Study Accession]	idr0101																																						Study Title	In situ genome sequencing resolves DNA sequence and structure in intact biological samples																																					Study Type	DNA sequencing																																						Study Type Term Source REF	EFO																																						Study Type Term Accession	EFO_0002693																																					Study Description	Understanding genome organization requires integration of DNA sequence and 3D spatial context, however, existing genome-wide methods lack either base-pair sequence resolution or direct spatial localization. Here, we describe in situ genome sequencing (IGS), a method for simultaneously sequencing and imaging genomes within intact biological samples. We applied IGS to human fibroblasts and early mouse embryos, spatially localizing thousands of genomic loci in individual nuclei. Using these data, we characterized parent-specific changes in genome structure across embryonic stages, revealed single-cell chromatin domains in zygotes, and uncovered epigenetic memory of global chromosome positioning within individual embryos. These results demonstrate how in situ genome sequencing can directly connect sequence and structure across length scales from single base pairs to whole organisms.																																					Study Key Words	DNA sequencing	microscopy	genome structure	embryo	development																																					Study Organism																																					Study Organism Term Source REF	NCBITaxon																																					Study Organism Term Accession																																						Study Experiments Number	2																																					Study External URL	https://buenrostrolab.shinyapps.io/insituseq/
